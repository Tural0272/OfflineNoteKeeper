Can you confirm that everything in the checklist is fully implemented? Please go through each requirement carefully and check the following:

✅ Technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) – Open the code and ensure that only pure JavaScript (or libraries like Bootstrap) is used. No React, Vue, or Angular.

✅ PWA (Installable App)

Check if manifest.json exists in the root directory.
It should include name, icons, theme_color, and start_url.
Try installing the app in Chrome (click the install icon in the address bar).
✅ Native Device Features (At least 2)

Camera (navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia)
Speech-to-text (webkitSpeechRecognition or SpeechRecognition)
Verify that they actually work (e.g., take a photo and dictate text).
✅ Offline Functionality

Check if sw.js (Service Worker) is present.
Enable "Offline" mode in DevTools (F12 → Network → Offline) and try to use the app – it should still work.
✅ Three or More Screens

Main screen (list of notes)
Create/Edit note screen
Settings (export, dark mode)
Open each screen and ensure navigation is logical.
✅ Hosting (HTTPS)

The app should be live online (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages).
Run window.location.protocol in the browser console – it should return "https:".
✅ Responsiveness

Open DevTools (F12 → Toggle Device Toolbar) and check how the app looks on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
✅ Performance

Open DevTools → Lighthouse → Check Performance, PWA, Best Practices.
The app should load fast.
✅ Caching (Cache API)

Check sw.js to see which files are cached.
Enable "Offline" mode and refresh the page – it should still load.
✅ Data Storage (Local or HTTP-based API like Rover)

The app should use either LocalStorage/IndexedDB for local data persistence or an HTTP-based API (e.g., Rover) for fetching/saving data.
No full database setup is required.
✅ Documentation (README, Comments)

Open README.md – it should include:
Project description
Setup instructions
List of technologies used
The code should be clean and well-structured.
📌 Final Check:
✅ If everything above works correctly, the project is 100% complete.
❌ If anything is missing, improvements are needed before submission.

Have you checked any of these points already? Are there any issues?"
